# Icebox

Lightwallet-powered cold storage solution.

## Deprecation notice

Icebox is currently *deprecated*. We strongly advice against using the
software since it is no longer being maintained.

## Alternatives

As of April 2020 there are other well maintained software tools that
has the cold-storage functionality that Icebox had. We recommend
[Parity Signer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parity-signer/id1218174838)
for iOS and [MyCrypto](mycrypto.com) running in offline mode.

## Recovering funds

If you used Icebox to store Ether and/or tokens, you can recover them by using
MyCrypto and downloading the [desktop app](https://download.mycrypto.com).

Run the MyCrypto desktop app on an offline computer, use the "Mnemonic
Phrase" option and use `m/0'/0'/0'` as the derivation path (there
should be a preset one called "SingularDTV"). Now you should be able
to view and send ETH and tokens out of your addresses.
